### Example input

```python
question = "Given 2 parallel lines, and an intersecting line, what should the value of the sum of expertiot opposite angles be?"
```
### Example output
```python
AnswerStepResponse(
    answer_value="Great! Let's get started. When two lines are parallel, they never meet ‚Äî even if extended infinitely. Can you recall how their corresponding angles relate?",
    solving_completed=False
```

### Usage Example
```python 
from uagents import Agent, Context
